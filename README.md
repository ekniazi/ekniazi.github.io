1. The Service

The Png To Svg application is designed to convert image files (specifically PNG format) uploaded by the user into Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.

2. User Content & Ownership

2.1 Ownership of Content

You retain all rights to the PNG files and the resulting SVG files (collectively, "User Content") that you upload, convert, or otherwise transmit through the Service. We claim no ownership over your User Content.

2.2 Limited License to Us

By using the Service, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use your User Content solely for the purpose of operating, providing, and improving the Service (e.g., uploading the PNG file, processing it on our servers, and returning the SVG file to you).

2.3 Data Retention

All User Content (your uploaded PNG file and the converted SVG file) is automatically and permanently deleted from our servers immediately after the conversion process is complete and the resulting SVG file is delivered to you, or if the conversion is canceled. We do not store your files long-term.

2.4 Legal Use

You warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize us to use all User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in these Terms. You agree not to upload any content that is illegal, defamatory, infringes on any intellectual property rights, or violates any third-party rights.
